## Challenge 47 – Workflow Engine

### Overview
Implement a workflow engine for business process automation with visual workflow design and execution tracking.

### Features
- Visual workflow designer
- Workflow execution engine
- Task scheduling and orchestration
- Parallel and conditional execution
- Workflow versioning and deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
- Redis for task queuing

### Setup
- Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`

### Run
- Backend: `npm start` in `backend`
- Frontend: `npm start` in `frontend`

### Environment
- `DATABASE_URL` (required)
- `REDIS_URL` (default redis://localhost:6379)
- `PORT` (default 3000)

### Endpoints
- `POST /workflows` → Create new workflow
- `POST /workflows/:id/execute` → Execute workflow
- `GET /workflows/:id/status` → Get workflow status
- `POST /tasks` → Create workflow task

### Testing
- Design and execute sample workflows
- Test parallel and conditional execution
- Verify error handling in workflows
- Test workflow versioning

### Notes
- Implement workflow state persistence
- Handle long-running workflows with checkpoints
- Support workflow rollback and compensation
- Provide execution monitoring and debugging
