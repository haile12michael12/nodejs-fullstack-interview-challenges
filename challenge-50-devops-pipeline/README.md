## Challenge 50 â€“ DevOps Pipeline

### Overview
Create a complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, deployment, and monitoring for a Node.js application.

### Features
- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Continuous deployment to multiple environments
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Docker/Terraform
- Automated rollback and blue-green deployment
- Monitoring and alerting integration

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- GitHub/GitLab account
- Cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Setup
- Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`

### Run
- Backend: `npm start` in `backend`
- Frontend: `npm start` in `frontend`

### Environment
- `DEPLOY_ENV` (default development)
- `CI_REGISTRY` (container registry URL)
- `PORT` (default 3000)

### Testing
- Set up CI pipeline with automated tests
- Configure CD pipeline with deployment stages
- Test blue-green deployment strategy
- Verify monitoring and alerting integration

### Notes
- Implement pipeline as code (YAML configuration)
- Use containerization for consistent deployments
- Include security scanning in pipeline
- Implement canary deployment strategy
