// HTTP-to-gRPC proxy server for the frontend
// This is a placeholder implementation since we're using Envoy in the Docker setup

console.log('Proxy server would be running here in a non-Docker environment');
console.log('In Docker, we use Envoy proxy instead');

// For local development without Docker, you might implement a simple proxy here
// But for this challenge, we'll rely on Envoy as specified in the architecture
